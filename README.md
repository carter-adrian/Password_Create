# Password_Create

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:
    I created the project to help grow my understanding of JavaScript. The project helped me to grasp some concepts that were (and kind of still are) illuding me. I have become more confident with arrays and some of the other terms associated with JS. Hopefully, more problems equal more knowledge. 

## Usage

This website, aside form the educational purpsose, is a great way to create a random password.
